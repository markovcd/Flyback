# VideoSynth

A patchable video synthesiser for .NET 10. Images are generated the way an
analogue synth generates sound: oscillators, maths and feedback, evaluated per
pixel. Nothing is drawn — every frame is a function of `(x, y, t)`.

```
Coordinates ──▶ Sine ──┐
                        ├──▶ Add ──▶ Remap ──▶ HSV ──▶ Output
Coordinates ──▶ Sine ──┘
```

## Running it

```bash
dotnet run --project src/VideoSynth.App -c Release
```

## How it works

A patch is a graph, but the graph is never walked while rendering. It compiles
to a flat, straight-line program over `float` registers:

```
Patch (nodes + wires)
  └─▶ PatchCompiler      walks back from Output, topologically
       └─▶ Op[]          e.g. r7 = Mul(r4, r6)
            └─▶ SynthRenderer   evaluated once per pixel, rows in parallel
```

This matters for three reasons: the inner loop has no virtual dispatch and no
allocation; anything the Output node can't reach is never compiled, so unused
modules cost nothing; and because each op is one line of arithmetic, the same
op list is what a future GLSL backend would emit rather than interpret.

Roughly 2 ms per 960×540 frame on a desktop CPU, so the preview has plenty of
headroom at 60 Hz.

### Coordinates

`y` runs −1 (bottom) to 1 (top). `x` is the same scale widened by the aspect
ratio, so a circle stays a circle. `t` is seconds since the patch started.

### Feedback

The renderer keeps the previous frame in linear float RGB, and the `Feedback`
module samples it. Route it back towards Output through `Rotate` or `Scale` and
you get the camera-pointed-at-its-own-monitor tunnel — the "Feedback tunnel"
preset does exactly that. Values are clamped to 0..1 each frame, which is what
stops the loop running away.

## Using the editor

| | |
|---|---|
| Add a module | click it in the left palette |
| Patch | drag from one socket to another |
| Unplug | drag a connected input away |
| Pan / zoom | drag the background or right-drag / mouse wheel |
| Frame the patch | `F` |
| Delete a module | `Delete` |
| Set exact values | select a module, use the inspector on the right |

Any input with nothing plugged into it uses the value shown on the node, so most
patches need no constant modules at all.

## Layout

| Project | |
|---|---|
| `src/VideoSynth.Core` | graph model, compiler, renderer, PNG writer — no UI dependency |
| `src/VideoSynth.App` | Avalonia editor and live preview, built in C# without XAML |

Why it is built this way is recorded in [docs/adr](docs/adr) — 21 decision
records covering the compiler, the renderer, the shell and the boundaries
between them.

## Adding a module

Everything about a module lives in one entry in `NodeCatalog`: its sockets and
the ops it lowers to. Nothing else in the pipeline needs to change — it shows up
in the palette and compiles on its own.

```csharp
new NodeDef(
    "pattern.rings", "Rings", "Pattern",
    [Num("x"), Num("y"), Num("freq", 4f, 0f, 32f), Num("offset")],
    [Num("out")],
    (em, i) =>
    {
        var radius = em.Binary(OpCode.Hypot, i[0], i[1]);
        return [em.Unary(OpCode.Sin, em.Mul(em.Add(em.Mul(radius, i[2]), i[3]), Tau))];
    },
    "Concentric sine rings.")
```

Ports typed `Any` pass through whatever arrives, which is how one `Multiply`
works on both a scalar and a colour.

## Files

Patches save as JSON (`.vsynth`). `Save frame…` renders the current moment at
1920×1080 and writes a PNG.
